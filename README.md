# CodeOnly 

Coming Soon.  A new front-end web framework, designed for coders.

## Tool Free
No transpiling, packaging or bundling to slow things down. Debug your code in the browser exactly as you wrote it.

## Non-Reactive
CodeOnly is not reactive (we have reasons :). No wrapper or proxy classes. Everything is kept as close to pure JavaScript as possible.

## Fast and Small
Templates are JIT compiled, minimal DOM updates and we've tuned it to run fast!
